# Colours

### Primary Colours
We use a restricted colour palette on gov.je to provide a strong brand presence and make our website accessible for all users.

|Colour|Name|Hex Code|SCSS Variable|Usage guide|
|------|----|--------|-------------|-----------|
|<ColourCircle hex="#B60011" />|__Red__|`#B60011`|`$colour-red`|​Red is the key colour that defines the gov.je website. Red is only used as an accent. Large red panels and backgrounds should be avoided.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#1D1D1B" />|__Charcoal__|`#1D1D1B`|`$colour-charcoal`|​Charcoal is used throughout the site for text and other graphic elements instead of black.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#585958" />|__Dark grey__|`#585958`|`$colour-dark-grey`|Dark grey is used as an alternative accent colour to the red. Dark grey is used for the cookie message and for the header background on the blog.gov.je website.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#7D7D7D" />|__Mid grey__|`#7D7D7D`|`$colour-mid-grey`|​This grey is used for the keyline under the light grey area on the home page that holds the search box. It provides a mid-tone option between the pale and dark greys in the primary palette.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#E0E0E0" />|__Pale grey__|`#E0E0E0`|`$colour-pale-grey`|​This colour is used for the borders of tables and the boxes around the page numbers as part of the paging controls on the search page template.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#EEF0F0" />|__Light grey__|`#EEF0F0`|`$colour-light-grey`|​Light grey is used on the site to help separate sections of pages for users. For example the side-panel site pages on gov.je that holds contact details.|
|<ColourCircle hex="#FFFFFF" />|__White__|`#FFFFFF`|`$colour-white`|​Use of white and whitespace is key to keeping the government suite of websites usable and accessible. The background of all pages should be white. Coloured panels are used only to help differentiate sections of a page.|

### Secondary Colours
Secondary colours should only be used to complement the primary colours. They are used for design elements across the website, not for general use.

### Colour exceptions for charts, graphs and data tables
There are 3 colours available to use for charts, graphs and data tables on gov.je.

Simple charts use grey or red. More detailed charts will need to use mixed colours.
